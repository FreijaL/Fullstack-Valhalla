# Valhalla Pizzeria 

This is the final fullstack group project made by Diamond Vikings.
We were tasked with creating a restaurant app suited for both customers and staff.

## Functionality overview:
For customers we've implemented functionality that lets them read the menu, add items to the cart, change quantities and place an order. 

For staff we've implemented functionality that lets them see active orders aswell as order history, they can update the status of active orders with the simple press of a button. 
There is also a page with a quick overview of how the system works for new workers to quickly get a grasp of the system.
